abstract = {PROBLEM/CONDITION Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has short- and long-term adverse clinical outcomes, including death and disability. TBI can be caused by a number of principal mechanisms, including motor-vehicle crashes, falls, and assaults. This report describes the estimated incidence of TBI-related emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and deaths during 2013 and makes comparisons to similar estimates from 2007. REPORTING PERIOD 2007 and 2013. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM State-based administrative health care data were used to calculate estimates of TBI-related ED visits and hospitalizations by principal mechanism of injury, age group, sex, and injury intent. Categories of injury intent included unintentional (motor-vehicle crashes, falls, being struck by or against an object, mechanism unspecified), intentional (self-harm and assault/homicide), and undetermined intent. These health records come from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's National Emergency Department Sample and National Inpatient Sample. TBI-related death analyses used CDC multiple-cause-of-death public-use data files, which contain death certificate data from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. RESULTS In 2013, a total of approximately 2.8 million TBI-related ED visits, hospitalizations, and deaths (TBI-EDHDs) occurred in the United States. This consisted of approximately 2.5 million TBI-related ED visits, approximately 282,000 TBI-related hospitalizations, and approximately 56,000 TBI-related deaths. TBIs were diagnosed in nearly 2.8 million (1.9{\%}) of the approximately 149 million total injury- and noninjury-related EDHDs that occurred in the United States during 2013. Rates of TBI-EDHDs varied by age, with the highest rates observed among persons aged ≥75 years (2,232.2 per 100,000 population), 0-4 years (1,591.5), and 15-24 years (1,080.7). Overall, males had higher age-adjusted rates of TBI-EDHDs (959.0) compared with females (810.8) and the most common principal mechanisms of injury for all age groups included falls (413.2, age-adjusted), being struck by or against an object (142.1, age-adjusted), and motor-vehicle crashes (121.7, age-adjusted). The age-adjusted rate of ED visits was higher in 2013 (787.1) versus 2007 (534.4), with fall-related TBIs among persons aged ≥75 years accounting for 17.9{\%} of the increase in the number of TBI-related ED visits. The number and rate of TBI-related hospitalizations also increased among persons aged ≥75 years (from 356.9 in 2007 to 454.4 in 2013), primarily because of falls. Whereas motor-vehicle crashes were the leading cause of TBI-related deaths in 2007 in both number and rate, in 2013, intentional self-harm was the leading cause in number and rate. The overall age-adjusted rate of TBI-related deaths for all ages decreased from 17.9 in 2007 to 17.0 in 2013; however, age-adjusted TBI-related death rates attributable to falls increased from 3.8 in 2007 to 4.5 in 2013, primarily among older adults. Although the age-adjusted rate of TBI-related deaths attributable to motor-vehicle crashes decreased from 5.0 in 2007 to 3.4 in 2013, the age-adjusted rate of TBI-related ED visits attributable to motor-vehicle crashes increased from 83.8 in 2007 to 99.5 in 2013. The age-adjusted rate of TBI-related hospitalizations attributable to motor-vehicle crashes decreased from 23.5 in 2007 to 18.8 in 2013. INTERPRETATION Progress has been made to prevent motor-vehicle crashes, resulting in a decrease in the number of TBI-related hospitalizations and deaths from 2007 to 2013. However, during the same time, the number and rate of older adult fall-related TBIs have increased substantially. Although considerable public interest has focused on sports-related concussion in youth, the findings in this report suggest that TBIs attributable to older adult falls, many of which result in hospitalization and death, should receive public health attention. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS The increase in the number of fall-related TBIs in older adults suggests an urgent need to enhance fall-prevention efforts in that population. Multiple effective interventions have been identified, and CDC has developed the STEADI initiative (Stopping Elderly Accidents Deaths and Injuries) as a comprehensive strategy that incorporates empirically supported clinical guidelines and scientifically tested interventions to help primary care providers address their patients' fall risk through the identification of modifiable risk factors and implementation of effective interventions (e.g., exercise, medication management, and Vitamin D supplementation).},

abstract = {We present an overview of the wide range of potential applications of optical methods for monitoring traumatic brain injury. The MEDLINE database was electronically searched with the following search terms: "traumatic brain injury," "head injury," or "head trauma," and "optical methods," "NIRS," "near-infrared spectroscopy," "cerebral oxygenation," or "cerebral oximetry." Original reports concerning human subjects published from January 1980 to June 2015 in English were analyzed. Fifty-four studies met our inclusion criteria. Optical methods have been tested for detection of intracranial lesions, monitoring brain oxygenation, assessment of brain perfusion, and evaluation of cerebral autoregulation or intracellular metabolic processes in the brain. Some studies have also examined the applicability of optical methods during the recovery phase of traumatic brain injury . The limitations of currently available optical methods and promising directions of future development are described in this review. Considering the outstanding technical challenges, the limited number of patients studied, and the mixed results and opinions gathered from other reviews on this subject, we believe that optical methods must remain primarily research tools for the present. More studies are needed to gain confidence in the use of these techniques for neuromonitoring of traumatic brain injury patients.},

abstract = {Spreading depolarisations occur spontaneously and frequently in injured human brain. They propagate slowly through injured tissue often cycling around a local area of damage. Tissue recovery after an spreading depolarisation requires greatly augmented energy utilisation to normalise ionic gradients from a virtually complete loss of membrane potential. In the injured brain, this is difficult because local blood flow is often low and unreactive. In this study, we use a new variant of microdialysis, continuous on-line microdialysis, to observe the effects of spreading depolarisations on brain metab-olism. The neurochemical changes are dynamic and take place on the timescale of the passage of an spreading depolar-isation past the microdialysis probe. Dialysate potassium levels provide an ionic correlate of cellular depolarisation and show a clear transient increase. Dialysate glucose levels reflect a balance between local tissue glucose supply and utilisation. These show a clear transient decrease of variable magnitude and duration. Dialysate lactate levels indicate non-oxidative metabolism of glucose and show a transient increase. Preliminary data suggest that the transient changes recover more slowly after the passage of a sequence of multiple spreading depolarisations giving rise to a decrease in basal dialysate glucose and an increase in basal dialysate potassium and lactate levels.},

abstract = {Spreading depolarizations (SDs) occur spontaneously with high incidence in patients with acute brain injury. They can be detected by subdural electrocorticographic recordings. We here characterize the dynamic metabolic response to these events. A microdialysis catheter was inserted into perilesional cortical tissue adjacent to a strip for electrocorticography following craniotomy in 10 patients. The microdialysis catheter was connected to an online microdialysis assay measuring glucose and lactate concentrations every 30 to 60 secs. Spontaneously occurring SDs systematically caused a reduction in dialysate glucose by-32.0 (mu)mol/L (range:-92.3 to-18.4 mol/L, n=90) and increase in lactate by +23.1 (mu)mol/L (range: +5.5 to +93.6 (mu)mol/L, n=49). The changes were sustained at 20 mins after the SD events and highly significant using an area under the curve analysis (P{\textless}0.0001). Multiple and frequent SDs led to a progressive stepwise depletion of brain glucose. Hence, SD events cause a massive energy imbalance and their frequent occurrence leads to a local insufficiency of glucose supply. Such a failure would compromise cellular repolarization and hence tissue viability. The findings offer a new mechanism to account for otherwise unexplained instances of depletion of brain microdialysate glucose. (copyright) 2010 ISCBFM All rights reserved.},

abstract = {After acute injury to the brain, neurons at the damage epicentre depolarize, and this depression of activity spreads outward in waves through the cortex. A recently published study sheds light on how spreading depolarization can produce secondary damage after traumatic brain injury (TBI), and a second study presents a technique for the noninvasive monitoring of this phenomenon in patients with brain injury. In a healthy brain, neuronal activity and cerebral blood flow are closely coupled: when neuronal depolarization increases in a given area, blood flow to that region also increases to restore intercellular concentrations of the ions necessary for neural function. After brain injury, however, the neurovascular response to depolarization can change. Jason Hinzman, who led the first study, explains: “in injured tissue these depolarizing waves can cause a reduction in cerebral blood flow, which produces a mismatch between the tissue's energy demand and supply. The resulting metabolic stress could lead to neuronal injury.”},

abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been identified as an important cause of death and severe disability in all age groups and particularly in children and young adults. Central to TBI's devastation is a delayed secondary injury that occurs in 30-40{\%} of TBI patients each year, while they are in the hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Secondary injuries reduce survival rate after TBI and usually occur within 7 days post-injury. State-of-art monitoring of secondary brain injuries benefits from the acquisition of high-quality and time-aligned electrical data i.e. ElectroCorticoGraphy (ECoG) recorded by means of strip electrodes placed on the brain's surface, and neurochemical data obtained via rapid sampling microdialysis and microfluidics-based biosensors measuring brain tissue levels of glucose, lactate and potassium. This article progresses the field of multi-modal monitoring of the injured human brain by presenting the design and realisation of a new, compact, medical-grade amperometry, potentiometry and ECoG recording bioinstrumentation. Our combined TBI instrument enables the high-precision, real-time neuroelectrochemical monitoring of TBI patients, who have undergone craniotomy neurosurgery and are treated sedated in the ICU. Electrical and neurochemical test measurements are presented, confirming the high-performance of the reported TBI bioinstrumentation.},

This highly versatile system has the ability to transmit the captured bio-data back to the user either in a wired (HDMI cable) or wireless (ZigBee protocol) manner, depending on the targeted application. The biological information that can be recorded by the proposed instrument spans a wide range of bio-potentials and bio-amperometric signals. The proposed instrument is split into two complementary “sub-instruments” where one is operating as the front-end device, responsible for the accurate, low-noise signal detection and transmission, while the second “sub-instrument” is operating as the “base station” responsible for the collection and further processing of the captured data. For wired transmission (e.g to the user's PC) the front end module can operate independently, however, for wireless transmission both “sub-instruments” are required (transmitter-base station architecture). For wireless transmission, each of the two “sub-instruments” is equipped with dedicated 2 Mbps ZigBee radio transceivers and both parts are controlled by a small area embedded FPGA module. The front-end device features two distinct sections: (a) a current/voltage to voltage section comprising six potentiometry and two transimpedance amplifier-based amperometry channels. These eight in total analogue channels are converted into digital form by means of a 24 bit, voltage input, Analogue-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and (b) a four channel, commercially available switched-capacitor-based ADC Integrated Circuit (IC), which converts input charge to digital data with 16 or 20 bit resolution at 3.125 kSPS. The paper presents a plethora of measured wired and wireless experimental results, corresponding to most well-known biomedical and other biological/physical signals including: EEG, ECoG, EMG, ECG, PPG, intracardiac atrial fibrillation (AF) signals, cell media/tissue biopotential, drosophila H1-cell spiking signals and pH sensing using commercially available electrodes. The portable/wearable poly-instrument is suitable for Intensive Care Unit (ICU), High Dependancy Unit (HDU) as well as home monitoring.},

abstract = {Injuries are one of the most serious public health problems facing the United States today. Through premature death, disability, medical cost, and lost productivity, injuries impact the health and welfare of all Americans. Deaths only begin to tell the story. Although many injuries are minor, a large proportion results in fractures, amputations, burns, or significant injuries that have far-reaching consequences. Now, for the first time in over fifteen years, there are comprehensive estimates of the impact of these injuries in economic terms. This book updates a landmark Report to Congress from 1989. Since that report, no undertaking has addressed the incidence and economic burden of injuries with more timely data, despite major changes in the fields of prevention, reporting and surveillance. Since the mid-eighties, new safety technologies have been developed to prevent injuries or to decrease the severity of injuries, and new policies and laws have been enacted to promote injury prevention. Chapter topics include incidence by detailed categorizations, lifetime medical costs, and productivity losses as a result of injuries, and a discussion of recent trends.},

abstract = {Ultra low power communication mechanisms are essential for future Internet of Things deployments. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is one promising candidate for such deployments. We study the energy consumption of BLE by measuring real devices with a power monitor and derive models of the basic energy consumption behavior observed from the measurement results. We investigate also the overhead of Ipv6-based communication over BLE, which is relevant for future IoT scenarios. We contrast our results by performing similar measurements with ZigBee/802.15.4 devices. Our results show that when compared to ZigBee, BLE is indeed very energy efficient in terms of number of bytes transferred per Joule spent. In addition, IPv6 communication energy overhead remains reasonable. We also point out a few specific limitations with current stack implementations and explain that removing those limitations could improve energy utility significantly.},

abstract = {Many medical devices that are implanted in the body use wires or wireless radiofrequency telemetry to communicate with circuitry outside the body. However, the wires are a common source of surgical complications, including breakage, infection and electrical noise. In addition, radiofrequency telemetry requires large amounts of power and results in low-efficiency transmission through biological tissue. As an alternative, the conductive properties of the body can be used to enable wireless communication with implanted devices. In this article, several methods of intrabody communication are described and compared. In addition to reducing the complications that occur with current implantable medical devices, intrabody communication can enable novel types of miniature devices for research and clinical applications.},

@article{Tasker2012,
abstract = {Comments on an article by Jed A. Hartings and colleagues (see record [rid]2011-27221-015[/rid]). In their article, Hartings and colleagues reported their findings of electrocorticography in 103 patients requiring intensive care and surgery for traumatic brain injury (TBI). They found an association between the presence and type of spreading depolarization during acute ictus and survival and functional outcome 6 months later. The investigators suggest that, after further clinical studies, individualized care could include monitoring and treatment of spreading depolarization. Two issues arise from this excellent report. In the international arm of the trial, there was a subgroup assessment of patients who underwent operation for mass lesions (which was similar to the types of operations and patients in Hartings and colleagues' study). On inspection of these data—in view of the limitations of small sample size and a quick post-hoc analysis using information from the tables— the use of intravenous Selfotel (5 mg/kg once a day) for 4 days did not seem to reduce the proportion of patients dying. The electrophysiological and ionic transients of cortical spreading depolarization are NMDA-receptor mediated, and inhibition can be induced by agents acting at the NR2B, glycine, or non-competitive binding sites. Such protection of white matter injury in severe TBI would indeed be in keeping with outcome long after such injury. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

There is much here for everyone. The work is current, fairly complete, objective, and very readable compared with other general surgical textbooks.' Surgical Infections on the First Edition. The second edition of Surgery: Basic Science and Clinical Evidence features fully revised and updated information on the evidence-based practice of surgery, significant new sections on trauma and critical care on the often challenging surgical care of unique populations; (elderly, pediatric, immunocompromised, and obese patients). The internationally recognized editors and authors have maintained their evidence-based approach throughout the text with thoughtful and timely new chapters on the pre- and post-operative care of the cardiac surgery patient, intestinal transplantation, surgical infections, the fundamentals of cancer genetics and proteomics, and discussions of electrosurgical instruments, robotics, imaging modalities, and other emergingtechnologies influencing the modern practice of surgery. The oft-cited chapter on the principles of evidence-based decision-making in surgical practice is completely updated for the second edition, presenting the reader with a framework for the evidence-based practice of surgery. The First Edition's strong emphasis on the basic science underlying the practice of surgery is upheld, providing readers with solid preparation for inservice and recertification examinations. Clinically focused sections in gastrointestinal, vascular, cardiothoracic, transplant, and cancer surgery enable the surgeon to make decisions based upon the most relevant data. The text is enhanced by more than 1,000 illustrations and hundreds of the signature evidence-based tables that made the first edition of SURGERY an instant classic. With is strong basic science coverage and emphasis on evidence-based decision making, the Second Edition is required reading for all general surgery trainees, practitioners, and surgical subspecialists.},
